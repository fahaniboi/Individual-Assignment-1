# Individual Assignment 1
 The base structure of teh scene is the player looking for a sphere in a building of some sort. In our gdw game the main mission is for the player to search for the scientist and the sphere in my Assignment 1 scene represents the scientist and the building represents a Labratory. Which is why the win/lose condition requires the player to search for a sphere. The player jumps super high because I would get errors when creating stars for the player to use to navigate to the higher floor. The Layermask would not work for some reason and I ended up giving the player an absurd amount of Jumpforce. 

 For the Illumination Lightings, I chose Diffuse and DiffuseWrap because they were the only illuminations I had knowledge of while my groupmate decided to do Toon Ramp and Simple Specular. 

 For the LUT or the color grading portions, We were to create a custom LUT along with a Warm LUT as well as Cool LUT. Since my GDW game takes place in the 1970s, I tried to create a type pf Older Style LUT, however when implemented into Unity, It didn't really look or feel like an Older Style however I still liked how it loojed and decided to keep it in the project. 

 I implemented Normal Mapping as well as Bump Diffuse becuase my groupmate really wanted to do Rim lighting and something not covered in class. Normal mapping was used with a brick texture to give the labratory a solid building look. I used Bump Diffuse to have fun with different textures and see how it would look mixing in an Ink splash texture with a brick texture.
